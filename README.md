# HEALTH APP

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` for UI and backend

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Backend will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

### `npm run backend` for backend only

Backend will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
You can check data in db.json (run by json-server)

### Hightlight
- ReactJS (create-react-app)
- Redux Toolkit
- React router dom v5
- Bootstrap v5
- Sass
- Json-server
- Axios
- ChartJS

### Issues
- Take time for data mock up to implement feature `Load More` and `Filter`
- Don't have enought time for `Error handling` and `Preload data` or `Modules Bundle`
- Don't have enought time for `responsive`

### Note
- Data and UI are separated (load data from Redux state)
